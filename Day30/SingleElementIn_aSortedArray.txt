Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
      //the idea is to find mid element and if mid is single return it
        //else mid is first element of the pair and 
            //is at even pos means ans will be to it's right
            //else ans will be it's left
        //else mid is second element and 
            //is at odd pos means ans will be towards right
        //else ans will be towards left
        
        if(nums.length==1){
            return nums[0];
        }
        
        int lo = 0,hi = nums.length-1;
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid = lo +(hi-lo)/2;
            
            
            //means mid is second element of the pair
            if(mid-1>=0 &&(nums[mid]==nums[mid-1])){
